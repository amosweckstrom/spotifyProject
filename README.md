Spotify web abi project

This is a app that uses the spotify web api to retrive information from a users account.

The final purpose of the app would be:
1. Accesing multiple users playlists using Oauth2
2. Reading the tracks from the playlists and storing them temporarily.
3. Go through all the tracks from 2 or more users
4. give the tracks a scoring depending on the amount listened /frequency in playlists
5. Generate a playlist with the tracks.

The spotify web api uses Oauth 2 authorization.

The app is not finished and is a work in progress.
